# Sprint 1 Work Division

## Firebase Store

- **Save Calendar Events:**  
  Store calendar events online on Firestore.  
  Decide on key types (time slots/events). This poses the first challenge for the mid-sprint.

- **Local Calendar Duplication:**  
  Maintain a local version of the calendar.  
  - When adding a new event, update the local version.  
  - Ensure Firebase is updated once the app is back online.  
  - Learn how to implement a local dataset in Flutter.

## Features to Implement

- **Floating Action Button (FAB):**  
  Add an event using the FAB.  
  - On press, navigate to the "Add Event" page.  
  - Design the page similar to a Google Calendar popup ([Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxs8Zy2O4wk)).

- **Navigation Drawer Implementation**

- **Login Pages:**  
  - Main login page  
  - Change password page  

- **Profile Settings**

- **App Settings:**  
  Preferences  

- **Other Pages:**
